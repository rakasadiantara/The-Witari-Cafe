# TheWitariCaffe

the witari cafe is a website for ordering coffee and desserts that aims to minimize direct contact between customers and the manager of the cafe, both waiters and barists. 
Here I use Oracle database, PHP programming language and Java script. Built using HTML and beautified with CSS and bootstrapping framework.
